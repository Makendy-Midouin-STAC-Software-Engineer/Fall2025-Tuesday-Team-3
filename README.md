## ðŸŒ± Branch Workflow


We use **trunk-based flow** with `main` and `develop`:

- **main** = stable, demo-ready only (protected: PRs required)
- **develop** = integration/testing for the current sprint
- **feature/*** = short-lived branches for each task/story

### Create a feature branch (from `develop`)
```bash
git switch develop
git pull origin develop
git switch -c feature/<area>-<task>
# e.g., feature/frontend-search-ui, feature/backend-search-endpoint

### Pull Requests
All work must be pushed to a feature branch and opened as a Pull Request **into `develop`**.  
A teammate reviews the PR, and only the reviewer merges it into `develop`.  
No one merges their own code.
